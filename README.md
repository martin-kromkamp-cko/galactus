# Galactus

Galactus is the central Processing configuration service. It's setup in a way to act as the source of truth for merchant configuration while giving internal teams the freedom to consume this data in a way convenient to their systems.

## Authentication

Authentication on Galactus is managed trough Okta for end-users and internal Access (TODO!) for service to service communication. Given the scope of the K/V nodes they are only accessible with service to service authentication.

TODO: Describe how to use this

## Interfaces

Galactus exposes merchant configuration in four high level ways.

- [Rest API]()
- [GraphQL API]()
- [Change events]()
- [K/V nodes]()

The first two (Rest/GraphQL API) are focused on low volume flexible consumption. The latter two (change events and K/V nodes) are for high volume and low latency access.

### Rest API

The rest API is for well known, and there for optimized, access patterns. These support stable CAT features and Dashboard systems. 
Usually features start are build on top of the GraphQL API first for flexibility and are migrated to optimized Rest endpoints once the feature becomes stable.

In all environments, except production, the OpenAPI schema is enabled and an web UI is provided to interact with the api
```http request
https://[url:port]/swagger/
https://[url:port]/swagger/v1/swagger.json
```

### GraphQL API

The GraphQL API serves two main purposes, data exploration and front-end development flexibility.

Data exploration is critical for internal end-users as it unlocks to ask creative and one-off questions to the data graph without the need for support from development teams. These questions are often analytical and of a temporary nature. Introducing specialized rest endpoints isnÂ´t desireable for that case.

Giving the front-end teams the flexibility to explore building new features without the involvement of other development teams to get the needed endpoints build first is key to decouple development lifecycle and remove friction between teams. For this reason the GraphQL is available to these systems to use. In order to protect the system from in-efficient resource usage it is more often than not desirable to promote the GraphQL queries to optimized Rest endpoints once a front-end feature is stable.

In all environments, except production, schema introspection is enabled and an web UI is provided to interact with the /graphql endpoint
```http request
https://[url:port]/graphql/
```

### Change events

Galactus keeps tracks of and published internal changes trough change events. Internal system that have interest in all, or a subset, of these events can subscribe to the event stream.

### K/V nodes

TODO

## Database

Galactus is build on top of a relation database (PostgreSQL) and is leveraging Entity Framework Core to manage it's schema and remove the boilerplate of writing queries by hand.

To add migrations after model changes

``` shell
dotnet ef migrations add [MIGRATION_NAME] -p src/Processing.Configuration.Infra -s src/Processing.Configuration.Api/ --context AuditContext
dotnet ef migrations add [MIGRATION_NAME] -p src/Processing.Configuration.Infra -s src/Processing.Configuration.Api/ --context ProcessingContext
```

To apply the migrations

```shell
dotnet ef database update -p src/Processing.Configuration.Infra -s src/Processing.Configuration.Api/  --context AuditContext
dotnet ef database update -p src/Processing.Configuration.Infra -s src/Processing.Configuration.Api/  --context ProcessingContext
```

## Auditing

All API level requests that potentially modify data are audited and written to to the `audit_event` table.

## Local Development

To start local development you need the following
- [.net 6.x SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- Favorite editor/IDE
  - [Visual Studio (Code)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/tools)
  - [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
  - [Anything that support Omnisharp](https://www.omnisharp.net/#integrations)

To run Galactus locally bring up the Docker stack
``` shell
docker-compose up -d
```
